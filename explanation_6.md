# Problem 6
## Max and Min in an Unsorted Array
### Design choices
This was a trick question. My design choice was not to use a sorting algorithm, and save on both space and time.
All that I needed to do was traverse the array once, tracking the highest and lowest number seen so far.

### Time Complexity
This runs in O(n) time, where n is the number of items in the array. Only one iteration required.

### Space complexity
The space complexity is constant.
